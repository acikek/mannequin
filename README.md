This mod turns self-destructive behavior into something creative and social.

- While wielding a sword or an axe, hold the interact and attack buttons together to sever one of your limbs. Swords cut arms, and axes chop legs.
- Do anything with your detached limb. Display it, gift it to another player, or cling to it longingly.
- Open wounds bleed. Drain enough blood to **become a doll**.
- Dolls may re-attach limbs to their bodies, including ones that aren't their own. Using an axe, they can even separate their heads from their torsos.
